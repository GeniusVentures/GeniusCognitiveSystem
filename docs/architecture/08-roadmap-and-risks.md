# **11 Execution Roadmap**

---

## **11.1 Phase 1 — Semantic Core Foundations**

* Base model selection.
* FP4 v3 quantization pipeline.
* Validate activation error.
* Deploy across initial nodes.

Deliverable: `genius-core-alpha`

---

## **11.2 Phase 2 — Experts + Router / Planner**

* Initial role-based expert integration.
* Initial domain-specialist integration.
* Routing and planning logic implementation.
* Grounding path selection.
* Memory governor introduction.

Deliverable: `genius-modular-alpha`

---

## **11.3 Phase 3 — Reputation, Memory, and Consensus**

* Implement reputation storage.
* Implement weighted consensus and arbiter path.
* Sync via CRDT.
* Structured memory retrieval and write governance.
* Multi-node task execution.

Deliverable: `genius-swarm-beta`

---

## **11.4 Phase 4 — Grounding, Private Customization, Secure Agent Path, and Benchmarks**

* Grokipedia retrieval integration.
* Private grounding support.
* Private memory and private ELM customization path.
* Tool intermediary and attestation path.
* Stress test.
* Publish benchmark comparison.

Deliverable: `GeniusCognitiveSystem v1 Beta`

# **12 Risk Analysis**

Risk

Mitigation

FP4 underperforms

Fallback to INT4 or adjusted quantization policy

Reputation gaming

Require minimum history and verifier-aware scoring

Swarm latency high

Limit swarm width and prefer smallest effective cognitive set

Routing instability

Keep rule-based v1 and phase in learned routing carefully

Memory contamination

Use provenance-aware write gates and trust classes

Unsafe tool execution

Require intermediary attestation and approval gates

Customization path confusion

Keep retrieval, memory, and private ELM adaptation as separate governed levers
