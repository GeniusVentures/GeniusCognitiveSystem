# **18. EGGROLL Swarm Retraining Architecture**
## **18.1 Purpose**

This document defines how GeniusCognitiveSystem extends beyond distributed inference into distributed retraining using an EGGROLL-style evolutionary optimization workflow mapped onto GNUS.ai swarm infrastructure.

The goal is not to replace the existing GeniusCognitiveSystem architecture.
The goal is to add a swarm-native retraining layer that allows the Semantic Core, expert models, adapters, routing policies, and verifier-like modules to be improved using locality-aware peer coordination, deterministic perturbation reconstruction, compact fitness communication, and reputation-gated promotion.

This architecture treats retraining as a first-class GNUS.ai operating system primitive.

---

## **18.2 Architectural Position**

Within the GeniusCognitiveSystem, the major architectural roles become:

* **Semantic Core + Experts:** inference architecture
* **Router + Swarm Thinking Context:** execution and reasoning architecture
* **GAML:** memory and structured recall architecture
* **Reputation + Consensus:** trust and output selection architecture
* **EGGROLL Swarm Retraining:** specialist refresh and adaptation architecture

This means:

* **Adapter-style specialization remains valid as an adaptation artifact**
* **Expert-based routed execution remains the inference strategy**
* **EGGROLL becomes the distributed retraining and expert-refresh mechanism**

EGGROLL therefore complements the current design rather than replacing it.

---

## **18.3 Why EGGROLL Fits GNUS.ai**

Traditional distributed backpropagation assumes:

* tightly coupled GPUs
* high-bandwidth gradient exchange
* large optimizer state synchronization
* low-latency datacenter networking

That assumption does not match GNUS.ai.

GNUS.ai is:

* peer-to-peer
* locality-aware
* heterogeneous across devices
* reputation-mediated
* designed around distributed processing rooms, IPFS distribution, and compact network coordination

An EGGROLL-style method is a stronger fit because workers can:

* receive a model version reference
* reconstruct a low-rank perturbation from a deterministic seed
* evaluate local fitness
* return only compact fitness values and metadata

This converts much of retraining into an inference-like workload with minimal per-step network payload.

That property aligns naturally with:

* GNUS processing rooms
* DHT-based locality
* IPFS-lite model distribution
* libp2p pub/sub coordination
* gRPC result transport
* reputation-gated verification

---

## **18.4 Design Principles**

The EGGROLL retraining layer follows these principles:

### **18.4.1 Locality First**

Training work should preferentially remain within local beehives or sub-swarms that already hold the relevant model, adapter, task shard, or domain context.

### **18.4.2 Deterministic Reconstruction over Tensor Shipment**

Low-rank perturbations should be reconstructed from deterministic seeds rather than transmitted as full tensors.

### **18.4.3 Compact Fitness over Gradient Exchange**

Workers should return compact fitness signals, validation metadata, and attestations rather than full gradients or optimizer state.

### **18.4.4 Adapter-Oriented Evolution**

The preferred first retraining targets are expert adapters or specialist micro-models rather than full core-model retraining.

### **18.4.5 Reputation-Gated Promotion**

No retrained artifact should be promoted by raw fitness alone.
Promotion requires validation, safety checks, and reputation-aware acceptance.

### **18.4.6 Hierarchical Swarm Aggregation**

Retraining should scale from local room coordinators to higher-level aggregators rather than assuming a single global coordinator.

---

## **18.5 Relationship to Adapters and Expert Execution**

EGGROLL does not eliminate adapters, expert modularity, or routed execution.

Instead:

* **Adapters define one class of artifact being updated**
* **Expert execution defines how inference uses those artifacts**
* **EGGROLL defines how the swarm improves them over time**

Therefore the architectural progression becomes:

Base Model -> Expert Adapter / Expert Micro-Model -> Routed Inference -> Outcome Signal -> EGGROLL Retraining Job -> Improved Expert Version

This makes GeniusCognitiveSystem a system that can evolve expert capability using swarm-native retraining rather than relying exclusively on offline centralized fine-tuning.

---

## **18.6 Core Training Primitive**

The basic EGGROLL retraining primitive is:

**base model reference + target adapter reference + deterministic perturbation seed + task shard + reward function -> compact fitness packet**

At minimum, a training job should define:

* target model version or base model CID
* target adapter CID or expert artifact ID
* perturbation rank
* perturbation scale or sigma
* perturbation seed or seed range
* task shard reference
* reward or objective definition
* validation policy
* safety policy hash
* promotion policy

This primitive is intentionally compact and swarm-friendly.

---

## **18.7 GNUS Processing Room Mapping**

EGGROLL retraining should be implemented over GNUS processing rooms.

Mapping:

* **Processing room host** -> local retraining coordinator
* **Worker peers** -> perturbation evaluators
* **Data chunk / sub-block** -> task shard or seed assignment
* **Processing result** -> compact fitness packet
* **Room lifecycle** -> one training generation or one bounded retraining phase

This means GNUS does not need a completely separate training control plane.
It can reuse the processing-room model already used for distributed work assignment and result collection.

---

## **18.8 Beehives and Locality-Aware Sub-Swarms**

A beehive is a locality-aware sub-swarm that shares one or more of the following:

* cached model artifacts
* cached adapter artifacts
* domain-specific task shards
* geographic or network proximity
* hardware similarity
* policy or privacy boundary

Beehives are important because they reduce unnecessary artifact movement.

A beehive may specialize around:

* a model family
* a domain specialist
* a language or region
* an application domain
* a user-data enclave
* a hardware class such as GPU, CPU, mobile NPU, or low-memory edge device

Higher-level swarm retraining should aggregate across beehives rather than forcing every node to participate in every generation.

---

## **18.9 Deterministic Perturbation Reconstruction**

Perturbations should be reconstructed from deterministic seeds rather than stored or transmitted in full.

A seed derivation function may include:

* model version
* adapter version
* layer or module identifier
* worker node ID
* generation ID
* perturbation index

Example conceptual form:

`seed = H(model_version, adapter_version, layer_id, worker_id, generation_id, perturbation_id)`

This enables:

* reproducible evaluation
* auditability
* replay for dispute resolution
* compact job descriptions
* lower storage overhead
* selective fraud checking by re-running suspicious assignments

---

## **18.10 Worker Execution Model**

A retraining worker performs the following steps:

1. Resolve the referenced base model and adapter artifacts from local cache or IPFS-lite.
2. Reconstruct the perturbation from the assigned seed and rank.
3. Apply the perturbation to the target adapter or expert parameters.
4. Execute the assigned task shard locally.
5. Compute fitness according to the declared reward function.
6. Package fitness output, latency, and attestation metadata.
7. Return a compact result packet to the room coordinator.

This workload is intentionally closer to inference than to classical synchronized backpropagation.

---

## **18.11 Fitness Packet Design**

Fitness packets should be small, signed, and auditable.

A worker result should include at minimum:

```json
{
  "training_job_id": "uuid",
  "worker_node": "node_id",
  "artifact_target": "math_verifier_adapter_v3",
  "seed_range": [100000, 100255],
  "fitness_values": "packed_or_scalar_payload",
  "latency_ms": 123,
  "validation_flags": {
    "self_check_passed": true,
    "policy_hash_match": true
  },
  "result_signature": "ed25519"
}
```

Compact encoding is strongly preferred.
Model-size-independent communication is a core design goal.

---

## **18.12 Aggregation Model**

The local coordinator aggregates worker fitness packets into a weighted update.

Coordinator responsibilities:

* verify signatures and policy compatibility
* reconstruct perturbations from seeds
* weight valid worker fitness values
* reject malformed or suspicious results
* compute generation-level update candidates
* run validation checks before publication

Aggregation should be hierarchical when the swarm is large:

* worker -> room host
* room host -> beehive aggregator
* beehive aggregator -> broader promotion or merge layer

This preserves locality while allowing wider adoption of successful specialist updates.

---

## **18.13 Reputation and Validation Extensions**

Retraining introduces new trust problems because workers return compact scalar-like signals that are cheap to fake.

Therefore EGGROLL retraining requires:

* redundancy on sampled assignments
* challenge tasks
* hidden validation shards
* consistency checks across duplicate workers
* reputation penalties for suspicious deviation
* minimum reputation thresholds for high-value jobs

Recommended new reputation dimensions include:

* **Trainer_score**
* **Validation_score**
* **Adapter_promotion_score**
* **Domain_trainer_score** by specialist area

These extend the current reputation architecture rather than replacing it.

---

## **18.14 Embedded Retraining Loop**

The GeniusCognitiveSystem should support an embedded retraining loop.

### **18.14.1 Normal Inference Path**

1. Router selects core + specialists.
2. Swarm executes inference.
3. Aggregator produces final result.
4. Grounding, safety, and memory processes evaluate outcome quality.

### **18.14.2 Learning Event Creation**

A learning event may be emitted when one or more are true:

* exact correctness is known
* verifier disagreement identifies a recoverable failure
* grounding validation identifies contradiction
* formatting or schema checks fail
* user feedback is strongly positive or negative
* repeated workflow success creates a strong pattern

### **18.14.3 Retraining Conversion**

The learning event becomes a retraining job targeting a specific component such as:

* planner
* router
* numeric specialist
* math verifier
* formatter
* grounding specialist
* code specialist
* synthesizer or arbiter

### **18.14.4 Artifact Publication**

If validation passes, the new adapter or specialist version is:

* signed
* content-addressed
* distributed via IPFS-lite
* canary deployed
* reputation monitored before broad promotion

This makes retraining part of normal swarm operation rather than a separate offline process.

---

## **18.15 Best Initial Retraining Targets**

The first retraining targets should be specialist components with clear reward functions.

Recommended initial targets:

### **18.15.1 Numeric Specialist / Math Verifier**

Reward signals:

* exact-match correctness
* symbolic verification success
* arithmetic consistency

### **18.15.2 Router / Planner Specialist**

Reward signals:

* quality improvement vs baseline route
* latency-adjusted utility
* specialist selection accuracy

### **18.15.3 Formatter / Schema Specialist**

Reward signals:

* JSON validity
* schema compliance
* formatting correctness
* user preference match

### **18.15.4 Grounding Specialist**

Reward signals:

* factual agreement with retrieved knowledge
* contradiction reduction
* improved citation alignment

### **18.15.5 Code Specialist**

Reward signals:

* test pass rate
* compile success
* static analysis success
* minimal-diff acceptance

These targets are preferred because they are easier to score and safer to validate than full core-model evolution.

---

## **18.16 Safety and Governance Constraints**

EGGROLL retraining must follow the same safety and trust principles as inference.

Requirements:

* retraining jobs must carry policy hashes
* workers must use approved artifact versions
* unsafe or policy-violating outputs must not be promoted
* untrusted memory must not directly drive training without curation
* promotion should require validation against trusted evaluation sets
* high-impact adapters should use canary release before wider adoption

This ensures retraining does not become a backdoor for poisoning the specialist ecosystem.

---

## **18.17 Constraints and Non-Goals**

This architecture does not imply that arbitrary low-end devices can immediately retrain large dense models without other design changes.

Important constraints remain:

* workers must still execute the relevant model or adapter locally
* model size remains a deployment constraint
* heterogeneous devices introduce stragglers and availability variance
* scalar fitness communication reduces bandwidth, not compute demand
* local beehives can overfit if global mixing is poorly designed

Therefore the initial focus should be:

* small or medium specialist artifacts
* quantized or recurrent-friendly models
* domain-specific adapters
* validation-rich tasks with measurable outcomes

Full-core training should be treated as a later-stage research direction.

---

* beehive aggregators
* cross-beehive promotion
* canary adapter rollout
* broader swarm adoption logic

## **18.19 Strategic Positioning**

The strategic significance of this layer is that it makes training behave more like decentralized inference.

GNUS.ai should not frame this as merely distributed backpropagation over weak devices.
Instead it should be framed as:

**locality-aware swarm retraining through deterministic low-rank perturbation evaluation and compact fitness aggregation**

This gives GNUS.ai a differentiated operating-system-level story:

* distributed inference
* distributed memory
* distributed reputation
* distributed settlement
* distributed retraining

Together, these form a distributed adaptive intelligence system rather than only a decentralized inference network.

---

## **18.20 Summary**

EGGROLL Swarm Retraining adds a new capability to GeniusCognitiveSystem:

* specialist refresh without centralized gradient training
* beehive-local retraining based on locality and cached artifacts
* deterministic seed-addressed perturbations
* compact fitness communication
* reputation-gated validation and promotion
* embedded learning from real swarm outcomes

This layer does not replace the existing GeniusCognitiveSystem architecture.
It completes it by giving the swarm a native mechanism for improving its specialists over time.
