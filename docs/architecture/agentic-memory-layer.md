## **8.4 GNUS Agentic Memory Layer (GAML v1)**

## **8.4.1 Purpose**

The GNUS Agentic Memory Layer (GAML) introduces structured, reasoning-oriented long-term memory into GeniusCognitiveSystem.

Unlike traditional RAG pipelines that rely only on embedding similarity and vector databases, GAML treats retrieval as a governed cognitive process involving bridge blocks, facts, policies, events, trust metadata, and orchestration-aware selection.

GAML enables:

* Persistent structured memory across GNUS nodes
* Multi-hop reasoning over historical state
* Temporal coherence enforcement
* Swarm-consensus memory resolution where required
* Reduced dependency on brute-force transcript replay

This makes GeniusCognitiveSystem memory-native rather than prompt-extended.

## **8.4.2 Architectural Position**

GAML operates between:

* Router / Planner Layer
* Memory Governor
* Semantic Core / Expert Execution
* Grounding and Verification

## **8.4.3 Memory Object Model**

Long-term memory is stored as structured objects.

```ruby
MemoryObject {
  id: UUID
  entity: string
  type: {bridge_block, fact, policy, event, tenant_operational}
  payload: structured JSON
  timestamp: int64
  source_node: NodeID
  confidence_score: float
  provenance_score: float
  trust_class: {higher_trust, lower_trust}
}
```

Stored via:

* RocksDB (local node)
* IPFS-lite (distributed replication)
* CRDT synchronization (conflict resolution)

Embeddings may still be used where useful, but they are not the sole definition of memory.

---

## **8.4.4 Ingestion Pipeline**

When new information enters the system (conversation, task result, user preference, tool outcome), GAML evaluates multiple memory-oriented functions:

1. **Fact Extraction** – converts raw output into atomic structured facts where appropriate.
2. **Context Mapping** – associates facts and events with session, task, workflow, and user context.
3. **Temporal Tracking** – resolves updates, contradictions, and stale state.
4. **Write Evaluation** – scores novelty, expected utility, provenance, and contamination risk before durable storage.

The exact implementation may be heuristic, model-assisted, or hybrid depending on deployment stage.

---

## **8.4.5 Agentic Retrieval Mechanism**

For each memory query, GAML performs staged retrieval rather than raw log replay.

Representative retrieval stages:

* metadata prefiltering
* semantic matching where available
* temporal resolution
* policy and tenant boundary checks
* memory governor selection of final context set

Results may be merged using reputation-weighted, policy-aware selection when multiple nodes return conflicting or overlapping state.

---

## **8.4.6 Surprise-Gated Writes**

Surprise remains useful, but only as one signal among several. A memory write is favored when it is:

* novel
* useful for future routing or generation
* durable enough to matter
* allowed under policy
* consistent with the existing memory graph

---

## **8.4.7 Memory as Support for Experts**

Memory is not only for the Semantic Core. It also provides expert-specific context, such as:

* user style and formatting preferences for a Refiner or Formatter ELM
* domain facts for a Math or Scientific ELM
* prior tool state for a Tool-Support ELM
* historical conflicts for an Arbiter ELM
* tenant workflow rules for a private Operations ELM

---

## **8.4.8 Swarm Memory Consensus**

When multiple nodes return conflicting memory states:

1. Responses are scored using:
    * Node reputation
    * Confidence score
    * Recency
    * Provenance / trust class
2. Conflict resolution is performed using CRDT plus policy-aware weighted selection.
3. Final resolved memory is injected into inference, grounding, or verification context.

This prevents memory poisoning and maintains decentralized trust integrity.

---

## **8.4.9 Replication and Convergence**

Memory objects can be synchronized across devices and nodes using CRDT-style convergence and content-addressed integrity. This preserves local autonomy while enabling distributed continuity.

---

## **8.4.10 Performance & Overhead Impact**

Estimated impact in Swarm Mode:

* Additional memory-related compute and storage overhead
* Minimal GPU overhead relative to core inference in many deployments
* Horizontal scalability across GNUS nodes
* Reduced hallucination risk via structured recall

Compared to purely transcript-based context replay:

* Lower prompt bloat
* Better temporal coherence
* Better policy-aware context control

---

## **8.4.11 Strategic Impact**

GAML transforms GeniusCognitiveSystem v1 from:

Distributed Inference Engine  
→  
Distributed Cognitive System

It aligns directly with:

* Hierarchical Reasoning Model
* Semantic Core plus ELM execution
* Reputation-weighted consensus
* Distributed GNUS infrastructure
* Secure memory governance for agentic workflows

GAML v1 is intentionally practical.  
Future versions may deepen semantic indexing, memory governance, and private operational memory support as needed.
